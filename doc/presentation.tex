    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item \textbf{QCD.} We will go through and explain what QCD as well as motivate its existence.
        \item \textbf{LQCD.} We will briefly show how one discretise the lattice and perform calculations on it.
        \item \textbf{Gradient flow.} We will quickly introduce gradient flow and explain its effects.
        \item \textbf{GLAC.} Will briefly present the code which we developed as well as some benchmarks. We will also present the Metropolis algorithm.
        \item \textbf{Results.} We will present the results obtained from pure gauge calculations.
