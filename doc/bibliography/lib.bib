	abstract = {We study the topological charge distribution of the SU(3) Yang--Mills theory with high precision in order to be able to detect deviations from Gaussianity. The computation is carried out on the lattice with high statistics Monte Carlo simulations by implementing a naive discretization of the topological charge evolved with the Yang--Mills gradient flow. This definition is far less demanding than the one suggested from Neuberger's fermions and, as shown in this paper, in the continuum limit its cumulants coincide with those of the universal definition appearing in the chiral Ward identities. Thanks to the range of lattice volumes and spacings considered, we can extrapolate the results for the second and fourth cumulant of the topological charge distribution to the continuum limit with confidence by keeping finite volume effects negligible with respect to the statistical errors. Our best results for the topological susceptibility is t\_0{\textasciicircum}2*chi=6.67(7)*10{\textasciicircum}-4, where t\_0 is a standard reference scale, while for the ratio of the forth cumulant over the second we obtain R=0.233(45). The latter is compatible with the expectations from the large Nc expansion, while it rules out the theta-behavior of the vacuum energy predicted by the dilute instanton model. Its large distance from 1 implies that, in the ensemble of gauge configurations that dominate the path integral, the fluctuations of the topological charge are of quantum non-perturbative nature.},

An effective integrated autocorrelation time is computed which is suitable to benchmark efficiencies of simulation algorithms with regard to specific observables of interest.

The corresponding lattice actions for fermions are constructed and tree-level improvement conditions are derived by considering “classical” improvement. The concept of “on-shell” improvement is generalized to the lattice fermions studied here and the free parameters are determined for O(a) and O(a2) on-shell improved actions to all orders of perturbation theory. No evidence is found that the complicated structure of the O(a2) on-shell improved action, especially thearising fermion contact terms can be removed beyond tree level. The effect of terms in the action that explicitly break chiral symmetry and therefore remove the phenomenon of species doubling are investigated by considering the energy-momentum relations of the arising tree-level improved actions. Our main result is that the O(a) improved action is a slightly modified Wilson fermion action can still be written with only nearest-neighbour fermion interactions.},

Moreover, by transforming the QCD functional integral to an integral over the gauge field at a specified flow time, the emergence of the topological (instanton) sectors in the continuum limit becomes transparent and is seen to be caused by a dynamical effect that rapidly separates the sectors when the lattice spacing is reduced from 0.1 fm to smaller values.},

Moreover, it determines the relative lattice spacings of computations performed at diﬀerent values of the bare coupling, and this is needed for extrapolating results into the continuum. Thus, we calculate a new quantity, w0, for setting the scale in lattice QCD, which is based on the Wilson ﬂow like the scale t0 (M. Luscher, JHEP 1008 (2010) 071). It is cheap and straightforward to implement and compute. In particular, it does not involve the delicate ﬁtting of correlation functions at asymptotic times. It typically can be determined on the few per-mil level. We compute its continuum extrapolated value in 2 + 1-ﬂavor QCD for physical and non-physical pion and kaon masses, to allow for mass-independent scale setting even away from the physical mass point. We demonstrate its robustness by computing it with two very diﬀerent actions (one of them with staggered, the other with Wilson fermions) and by showing that the results agree for physical quark masses in the continuum limit.},

The ﬁrst part satisﬁes the initial/boundary conditions and contains no adjustable parameters. The second part is constructed so as not to affect the initial/boundary conditions. This part involves a feedforward neural network containing adjustable parameters (the weights). Hence by construction the initial/boundary conditions are satisﬁed and the network is trained to satisfy the differential equation. The applicability of this approach ranges from single ordinary differential equations (ODE’s), to systems of coupled ODE’s and also to partial differential equations (PDE’s). In this article, we illustrate the method by solving a variety of model problems and present comparisons with solutions obtained using the Galekrkin ﬁnite element method for several cases of partial differential equations. With the advent of neuroprocessors and digital signal processors the method becomes particularly interesting due to the expected essential gains in the execution speed.},

	abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	abstract = {We review results concerning the theta dependence of 4D SU(N) gauge theories and QCD, where theta is the coefficient of the CP-violating topological term in the Lagrangian. In particular, we discuss theta dependence in the large-N limit. Most results have been obtained within the lattice formulation of the theory via numerical simulations, which allow to investigate the theta dependence of the ground-state energy and the spectrum around theta=0 by determining the moments of the topological charge distribution, and their correlations with other observables. We discuss the various methods which have been employed to determine the topological susceptibility, and higher-order terms of the theta expansion. We review results at zero and finite temperature. We show that the results support the scenario obtained by general large-N scaling arguments, and in particular the Witten-Veneziano mechanism to explain the U(1)\_A problem. We also compare with results obtained by other approaches, especially in the large-N limit, where the issue has been also addressed using, for example, the AdS/CFT correspondence. We discuss issues related to theta dependence in full QCD: the neutron electric dipole moment, the dependence of the topological susceptibility on the quark masses, the U(1)\_A symmetry breaking at finite temperature. We also consider the 2D CP(N) model, which is an interesting theoretical laboratory to study issues related to topology. We review analytical results in the large-N limit, and numerical results within its lattice formulation. Finally, we discuss the main features of the two-point correlation function of the topological charge density.},

	abstract = {We review the present knowledge for \${\textbackslash}alpha\_s\$, the fundamental coupling underlying the interactions of quarks and gluons in QCD. The dependence of \${\textbackslash}alpha\_s(Q{\textasciicircum}2)\$ on momentum transfer \$Q\$ encodes the underlying dynamics of hadron physics -from color confinement in the infrared domain to asymptotic freedom at short distances. We review constraints on \${\textbackslash}alpha\_s(Q{\textasciicircum}2)\$ at high \$Q{\textasciicircum}2\$, as predicted by perturbative QCD, and its analytic behavior at small \$Q{\textasciicircum}2\$, based on models of nonperturbative dynamics. In the introductory part of this review, we explain the phenomenological meaning of \${\textbackslash}alpha\_s\$, the reason for its running, and the challenges facing a complete understanding of its analytic behavior in the infrared domain. In the second, more technical, part of the review, we discuss the behavior of \${\textbackslash}alpha\_s(Q{\textasciicircum}2)\$ in the high \$Q{\textasciicircum}2\$ domain of QCD. We review how \${\textbackslash}alpha\_s\$ is defined, including its renormalization scheme dependence, the definition of its renormalization scale, the utility of effective charges, as well as Commensurate Scale Relations which connect the various definitions of \${\textbackslash}alpha\_s\$ without renormalization-scale ambiguity. We also report recent measurements and theoretical analyses which have led to precise QCD predictions at high energy. In the last part of the review, we discuss the challenge of understanding the analytic behavior \${\textbackslash}alpha\_s(Q{\textasciicircum}2)\$ in the infrared domain. We also review important methods for computing \${\textbackslash}alpha\_s\$, including lattice QCD, the Schwinger-Dyson equations, the Gribov-Zwanziger analysis and light-front holographic QCD. After describing these approaches and enumerating their conflicting predictions, we discuss the origin of these discrepancies and how to remedy them. Our aim is not only to review the advances in this difficult area, but also to suggest what could be an optimal definition of \${\textbackslash}alpha\_s\$ in order to bring better unity to the subject.},

We construct a cluster expansion for ground states of local Hamiltonians, which naturally incorporates physical requirements inherited by locality as conditions on its cluster amplitudes. Applying a diagrammatic technique we derive the relation of these amplitudes to thermodynamic quantities and local observables. Moreover we derive a set of functional equations that determine the cluster amplitudes for a general Hamiltonian, verify the consistency with perturbation theory and discuss non-perturbative approaches. Lastly we verify the persistence of locality features of the cluster expansion under unitary evolution with a local Hamiltonian and provide applications to out-of-equilibrium problems: a simplified proof of equilibration to the GGE and a cumulant expansion for the statistics of work, for an interacting-to-free quench.},

	abstract = {Quantum field theory is arguably the most far-reaching and beautiful physical theory ever constructed, with aspects more stringently tested and verified to greater precision than any other theory in physics. Unfortunately, the subject has gained a notorious reputation for difficulty, with forbidding looking mathematics and a peculiar diagrammatic language described in an array of unforgiving, weighty textbooks aimed firmly at aspiring professionals. However, quantum field theory is too important, too beautiful, and too engaging to be restricted to the professionals. This book on quantum field theory is designed to be different. It is written by experimental physicists and aims to provide the interested amateur with a bridge from undergraduate physics to quantum field theory. The imagined reader is a gifted amateur, possessing a curious and adaptable mind, looking to be told an entertaining and intellectually stimulating story, but who will not feel patronised if a few mathematical niceties are spelled out in detail. Using numerous worked examples, diagrams, and careful physically motivated explanations, this book will smooth the path towards understanding the radically different and revolutionary view of the physical world that quantum field theory provides, and which all physicists should have the opportunity to experience.--},

The topological charge is measured on gauge configurations generated with a renormalization group improved gauge action and a mean field improved clover quark action at three values of \${\textbackslash}beta=6/g{\textasciicircum}2\$, corresponding to lattice spacings of \$a {\textbackslash}approx 0.22\$, 0.16 and 0.11 fm, with four sea quark masses at each \${\textbackslash}beta\$. The study is supplemented by simulations of pure SU(3) gauge theory with the same gauge action at 5 values of \${\textbackslash}beta\$ with lattice spacings 0.09 fm\${\textbackslash}simlt a {\textbackslash}simlt\$0.27 fm. We employ a field theoretic definition of the topological charge together with cooling. For the topological susceptibility in the continuum limit of pure SU(3) gauge theory we obtain \${\textbackslash}chi\_t{\textasciicircum}\{1/4\} = 197{\textasciicircum}\{+13\}\_\{-16\}\$ MeV where the error shows statistical and systematic ones added in quadrature. In full QCD \${\textbackslash}chi\_t\$ at heavy sea quark masses is consistent with that of pure SU(3) gauge theory. A decrease of \${\textbackslash}chi\_t\$ toward light quark masses, as predicted by the anomalous Ward-Takahashi identity for U(1) chiral symmetry, becomes clearer for smaller lattice spacings. The cross-over in the behavior of \${\textbackslash}chi\_t\$ from heavy to light sea quark masses is discussed.},

	abstract = {We introduce a hadronic scale \$R\_0\$ through the force \$F(r)\$ between static quarks at intermediate distances \$r\$. The definition \$F(R\_0)R\_0{\textasciicircum}2=1.65\$ amounts to \$R\_0 {\textbackslash}simeq 0.5\${\textasciitilde}fm in phenomenological potential models. Since \$R\_0\$ is well defined and can be calculated accurately in a Monte Carlo simulation, it is an ideal quantity to set the scale. In SU(2) pure gauge theory, we use new data (and \$R\_0\$ to set the scale) to extrapolate \$F(r)\$ to the continuum limit for distances \$r=0.18\${\textasciitilde}fm to \$r=1.1\${\textasciitilde}fm. Through \$R\_0\$ we determine the energy scale in the recently calculated running coupling, which used the recursive finite size technique to reach large energy scales. Also in this case, the lattice data can be extrapolated to the continuum limit. The use of one loop Symanzik improvement is seen to reduce the lattice spacing dependence significantly.

Numerical experiments verify these claims when applied to a problem on the orthogonal Stiefel manifold, and to an example arising from the semidiscretization of a linear inhomogeneous heat conduction problem.},

This is done by picking the coefficients of any classical RK scheme of the given order. 9 We must construct functions to correct for certain non-commutative effects to the given order.

It is desired to construct algorithms whose iterates also evolve on the same manifold. These algorithms can therefore be viewed as integrating ordinary differential equations on manifolds. The basic method "decouples" the computation of flows on the submanifold from the numerical integration process. It is shown that two classes of single-step and multistep algorithms can be posed and analyzed theoretically, using the concept of "freezing" the coefficients of differential operators obtained from the defining vector field. Explicit third-order algorithms are derived, with additional equations augmenting those of their classical counterparts, obtained from "obstructions" defined by nonvanishing Lie brackets.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03254},
	abstract = {We calculate the electric dipole moment of the nucleon induced by the QCD theta term. We use the gradient flow to define the topological charge and use \$N\_f = 2+1\$ flavors of dynamical quarks corresponding to pion masses of \$700\$, \$570\$, and \$410\$ MeV, and perform an extrapolation to the physical point based on chiral perturbation theory. We perform calculations at \$3\$ different lattice spacings in the range of \$0.07{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm fm\} {\textless} a {\textless} 0.11\$ fm at a single value of the pion mass, to enable control on discretization effects. We also investigate finite size effects using \$2\$ different volumes. A novel technique is applied to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the form factor calculations. The very mild discretization effects observed suggest a continuum-like behavior of the nucleon EDM towards the chiral limit. Under this assumptions our results read \$\{d\_\{n\}=-0.00186(59){\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}bar{\textbackslash}theta{\textbackslash} e{\textbackslash}text\{ fm\}\}\$ and \$\{d\_\{p\}=0.0015(12){\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}bar{\textbackslash}theta{\textbackslash} e{\textbackslash}text\{ fm\}\}\$.

	abstract = {The sample mean ¯¯¯X is probably the most popular estimator of the expected value in all sciences and var(¯¯¯X) measures the error (standard- and mean-square-errors). Here, an alternative approach to estimation of var(¯¯¯X) for time series data is presented. The method has an accuracy similar to dependent bootstrapping, but scales in O(n) time, and applies to stationary time series, including stationary Markov chains. The computational complexity is bounded by 12n floating point operations, but this can be reduced to n+O(1) in large computations. Convergence in relative error squared is faster than n−1/2 and the method is insensitive to the probability distribution of the observations. It is proven that a small part of the correlation structure is relevant to the convergence rate of the method. From this, proof of the Blocking method [Flyvbjerg and Petersen, J. Chem. Phys. 91, 461 (1989)] follows as a corollary. The result is also used to propose a hypothesis test surveying the relevant part of the correlation structure. It yields a fully automatic method which is sufficiently robust to operate without supervision. An algorithm and sample code showing the implementation is available for Python, C++, and R [www.github.com/computative/block]. Method validation using autoregressive AR(1) and AR(2) processes and physics applications is included. Method self-evaluation is provided by bias and mean-square-error statistics. The method is easily adapted to multithread applications and data larger than computing cluster memory, such as ultralong time series or data streams. This way, the paper provides a stringent and modern treatment of the Blocking method using rigorous linear algebra, multivariate probability theory, real analysis, and Fisherian statistical inference.},

With the help of recently proposed open boundary condition, it is possible to compute observables at a smaller lattice spacing since \{{\textbackslash}em trapping problem\} is absent. On the other hand, the reference energy scale provided by Wilson flow allows us to study their scaling behavior in contrast to previously proposed smearing techniques. The behavior of TCDC for different lattice spacings at a fixed HYP smearing level shows apparent scaling violations. In contrast, at a particular Wilson flow time \$t\$ for all the lattice spacings investigated (except the largest one), the TCDC data show universal behavior within our statistical uncertainties. The continuum properties of TCDC are studied by investigating the small flow time behavior. We have also extracted the pseudoscalar glueball mass from TCDC, which appears to be insensitive to the lattice spacings (0.0345 fm \${\textbackslash}leq a{\textbackslash}leq\$ 0.0667 fm) and agrees with the value extracted using anisotropic lattices, within statistical errors. Further, we have studied the localization property of \$q(x)\$ through IPR whose continuum behavior can be probed through the small values of Wilson flow time and observed the decrease of IPR with decreasing Wilson flow time. A detailed study of \$q(x)\$ under Wilson flow time revealed that as Wilson flow time decreases, the proximity of the regions of positive and negative charge densities of large magnitudes increases, and the charge density appears to be more delocalized resulting in the observed behavior of IPR.},

	abstract = {We study the critical slowing down towards the continuum limit of lattice QCD simulations with Hybrid Monte Carlo type algorithms. In particular for the squared topological charge we find it to be very severe with an effective dynamical critical exponent of about 5 in pure gauge theory. We also consider Wilson loops which we can demonstrate to decouple from the modes which slow down the topological charge. Quenched observables are studied and a comparison to simulations of full QCD is made. In order to deal with the slow modes in the simulation, we propose a method to incorporate the information from slow observables into the error analysis of physical observables and arrive at safer error estimates.},

	abstract = {We address a frequently asked question on the covariance fitting of the highly correlated data such as our \$B\_K\$ data based on the SU(2) staggered chiral perturbation theory. Basically, the essence of the problem is that we do not have an accurate fitting function enough to fit extremely precise data. When eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are small, even a tiny error of fitting function yields large chi-square and spoils the fitting procedure. We have applied a number of prescriptions available in the market such as the cut-off method, modified covariance matrix method, and Bayesian method. We also propose a brand new method, the eigenmode shift method which allows a full covariance fitting without modifying the covariance matrix at all. In our case, the eigenmode shift (ES) method and Bayesian method turn out to be the best prescription to the problem. We also provide a pedagogical example of data analysis in which the diagonal approximation and the cut-off method fail in fitting manifestly, but the ES method and the Bayesian approach work well.},

There has been enormous theoretical progress, since the publication of the Jefferson Lab proton form factor ratio data, aiming at reevaluating the picture of the nucleon.

The decay amplitude of the singlet field, on the other hand, depends strongly on N\_c and yields under the inclusion of mixing also a strong N\_c dependence for the eta decay. Both the eta and eta-prime decay are suited to confirm the number of colors to be N\_c=3.},

	abstract = {The strong CP-violating parameter is small today as indicated by constraints on the neutron electric dipole moment. In the early universe, the QCD axion has not yet relaxed to its QCD-cancelling minimum and it is natural to wonder whether this large CP violation could be responsible for baryogenesis. We show that strong CP violation from the QCD axion can be responsible for the matter antimatter asymmetry of the universe in the context of cold electroweak (EW) baryogenesis if the EW phase transition is delayed below the GeV scale. This can occur naturally if the Higgs couples to a O(100) GeV dilaton, as expected in some models where the Higgs is a pseudo-Nambu Goldstone boson of a new strongly interacting sector at the TeV scale. The only new relevant ingredients beyond the Standard Model in our framework are the QCD axion and an EW scale dilaton-like scalar field. The existence of such a second scalar resonance with a mass and properties similar to the Higgs boson will soon be tested at the LHC. In this context, the QCD axion would not only solve the strong CP problem, but also the matter anti-matter asymmetry and dark matter.},
